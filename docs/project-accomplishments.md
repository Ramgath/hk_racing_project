## Genaral Project Setup Accomplishments

* **✅ M0.1: Project Repository and Core Structure Established:**
    * GitHub repository (`hk_racing_project`) initialized and configured.
    * Standardized project directory structure (`src`, `docs`, `data`, `tests`, `notebooks`, `scripts`, `config`) implemented, promoting clear separation of concerns.
    * Comprehensive `.gitignore` file established to manage version control hygiene.
    * Initial `README.md` created, providing a project overview.

* **✅ M0.2: Master Plan Document (`master-plan.md`) Finalized:**

    * The "0. Project Definition and Establishment" section of `master-plan.md` has been thoroughly reviewed, refined, and finalized.
    * Key decisions regarding project workflow, toolset (VS Code, Colab), data handling strategies (direct BQ ingestion, GCS for models), and configuration management have been documented.
    * The `master-plan.md` now serves as a robust foundational document for the project.

* **✅ M0.3: Documentation Site (MkDocs) Configured and Operational:**

    * MkDocs and the Material theme successfully installed and configured.
    * `mkdocs.yml` created, defining site navigation, theme settings, and linking to the project repository.
    * The documentation site is buildable locally, providing a clear and accessible way to view project documentation.
    * (Optional, if done) GitHub Pages deployment for the documentation site is operational.

* **✅ M0.4: Standard Project Documentation Shells Created:**

    * Shell markdown files for all project phases (Phase 1 through Phase 8), `decisions.md`, and `project-status.md` have been created within the `docs/` directory.
    * The structure for `project-status.md` has been defined and implemented, enabling effective manual progress tracking.
    * This establishes a complete framework for ongoing project documentation.

* **✅  M0.5: Development Environment and Tooling Configured:**

    *   Local Python virtual environment (`.venv`) established.
    *   Core Python libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `requests`, `google-cloud-*`) installed via `requirements.txt`.
    *   Development libraries (e.g., `pytest`, `mkdocs`, `black`, `flake8`) installed via `requirements-dev.txt`.
    *   Visual Studio Code configured for Python development, including interpreter selection, linting (Flake8), and formatting (Black).
    *   Confirmed access to Google Colab and successful connection to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services from Colab environment.

* **✅ M0.6: Cloud Services (GCP) Initial Setup and Access Confirmed:**
**Accomplishments**:

    *   Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project established.
    *   Necessary APIs (BigQuery, Cloud Storage, IAM) enabled in the GCP console.
    *   A GCP Service Account created with appropriate roles (e.g., BigQuery Data Editor, Storage Object Admin) for data access.
    *   Service account JSON key downloaded, stored securely, and the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable configured for programmatic access.

* **✅ M0.7: Configuration Management Strategy Implemented:**
**Accomplishments**:

    *   `config/` directory established at the project root for centralized configuration management.
    *   An example configuration file, `config/config.yaml.example`, created, outlining the structure for data sources, GCP project ID, and BigQuery details.
    *   A local `config/config.yaml` file (copied from the example) created for actual project configurations.
    *   `config/config.yaml` added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental versioning of sensitive or environment-specific settings.
    *   A basic Python utility, `src/common/config_loader.py`, developed to load configurations from `config.yaml`.

## Phase 1 Accomplishments

* **✅ M1.1: BigQuery Environment Setup & Configuration**
    * The `hk_racing_dataset` and `hk_racing_scraped_raw` BigQuery datasets are created in the designated GCP project.
    * `config/config.yaml` updated to include `bq_main_dataset_id: "hk_racing_dataset"` and `bq_scraped_raw_dataset_id: "hk_racing_scraped_raw"`.
    * `src/common/config_loader.py` verified to correctly load these dataset IDs.
    * Purpose and intended content of each BigQuery dataset documented in `docs/phase-01-collection.md` (or equivalent documentation).

* **✅ M1.2: Ingestion of Processed Historical Data (Google Sheets to BigQuery)**
    *Table schemas in `hk_racing_dataset` (for `results`, `racecard`, `race_details`, `horse_register`) are defined and documented in Appendix A of `master-plan.md`, and corresponding tables are understood to be created/creatable in BigQuery.
