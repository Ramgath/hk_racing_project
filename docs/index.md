# HK Racing Project

**Executive Summary**  
The HK Racing Project is a data-driven initiative to ingest, model, and analyze horse racing data from the Hong Kong Jockey Club. Our goal is to build a robust end-to-end pipeline—covering data collection, schema design, pipeline orchestration, and analytics dashboards—to enable rapid iteration on performance metrics and machine-learning models.

**Objectives**  
- Ingest race results, horse and jockey data, and betting odds into BigQuery.  
- Define a clear, version-controlled data model and dictionary.  
- Build an automated pipeline (Google Sheets+ GCS + BigQuery).  
- Deliver KPI dashboards and exploratory notebooks for analytics and ML.
