# Project Status

**Last Manually Updated:** 2025-05-11

**Overall Project Health:** Green

*Initial setup and planning are progressing well. The new project structure and documentation plan are being finalized. only polishing touches to be done*

**Key Focus for This Week (ending 2005-05-10):**

**M5: Development Environment and Tooling Configured**
    * *Objective*: Set up local (VS Code) and cloud (Google Colab) development environments, including Python, necessary libraries, and IDE configurations.

## General Project Setup

*(Tasks related to overall project infrastructure, documentation, planning, and core technical setup before specific data work begins)*

---

### ✅ M1: Project Repository and Core Structure Established

**Objective**: Ensure the GitHub repository is correctly set up with a logical folder structure for code, docs, data, etc.

**Accomplishments**:

* GitHub repository (`hk_racing_project`) initialized and configured.
* Standardized project directory structure (`src`, `docs`, `data`, `tests`, `notebooks`, `scripts`, `config`) implemented, promoting clear separation of concerns.
* Comprehensive `.gitignore` file established to manage version control hygiene.
* Initial `README.md` created, providing a project overview.

*Opened: 08 May 2025*
*Completed: 08 May 2025*

### ✅ M2: Master Plan Document (`master-plan.md`) Finalized

**Objective**: Complete and finalize the comprehensive General Project Setup plan in `master-plan.md` incorporating all decisions from the initial planning phase.

**Accomplishments**:

* The "0. Project Definition and Establishment" section of `master-plan.md` has been thoroughly reviewed, refined, and finalized.
* Key decisions regarding project workflow, toolset (VS Code, Colab), data handling strategies (direct BQ ingestion, GCS for models), and configuration management have been documented.
* The `master-plan.md` now serves as a robust foundational document for the project.

*Opened: 08 May 2025*
*Completed: 09 May 2025*

### ✅ M3: Documentation Site (MkDocs) Configured and Operational

**Objective**: Set up MkDocs with the chosen theme, configure navigation in `mkdocs.yml`, and ensure the site builds and deploys correctly (e.g., to GitHub Pages).

**Accomplishments**:

* MkDocs and the Material theme successfully installed and configured.
* `mkdocs.yml` created, defining site navigation, theme settings, and linking to the project repository.
* The documentation site is buildable locally, providing a clear and accessible way to view project documentation.
* (Optional, if done) GitHub Pages deployment for the documentation site is operational.

*Opened: 08 May 2025*
*Completed: 09 May 2025*

### ✅ M4: Standard Project Documentation Shells Created

**Objective**: Create placeholder markdown files for all planned phases (e.g., `phase-01-collection.md`, `phase-02-cleansing.md`, etc.), a `decisions.md` log, and any other key supporting documentation. Finalize `docs/project-status.md` structure (current working version).

**Accomplishments**:

* Shell markdown files for all project phases (Phase 1 through Phase 8), `decisions.md`, and `project-status.md` have been created within the `docs/` directory.
* The structure for `project-status.md` has been defined and implemented, enabling effective manual progress tracking.
* This establishes a complete framework for ongoing project documentation.

*Opened: 08 May 2025*
*Completed: 09 May 2025*

### ✅  M5: Development Environment and Tooling Configured

**Objective**: Set up local (VS Code) and cloud (Google Colab) development environments, including Python, necessary libraries, and IDE configurations.

**Accomplishments**:

*   Local Python virtual environment (`.venv`) established.
*   Core Python libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `requests`, `google-cloud-*`) installed via `requirements.txt`.
*   Development libraries (e.g., `pytest`, `mkdocs`, `black`, `flake8`) installed via `requirements-dev.txt`.
*   Visual Studio Code configured for Python development, including interpreter selection, linting (Flake8), and formatting (Black).
*   Confirmed access to Google Colab and successful connection to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services from Colab environment.

*Opened: 08 May 2025*
*Closed: 10 may 2025*

### ✅ M6: Cloud Services (GCP) Initial Setup and Access Confirmed

**Objective**: Set up the Google Cloud Project, enable necessary APIs (BigQuery, Cloud Storage, IAM), and confirm programmatic access (e.g., service account credentials).

**Accomplishments**:

*   Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project established.
*   Necessary APIs (BigQuery, Cloud Storage, IAM) enabled in the GCP console.
*   A GCP Service Account created with appropriate roles (e.g., BigQuery Data Editor, Storage Object Admin) for data access.
*   Service account JSON key downloaded, stored securely, and the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable configured for programmatic access.

*Opened: 08 May 2025*
*Closed: 11 May 2025*

### ⏳ M7: Configuration Management Strategy Implemented

**Objective**: Establish the `config/` directory structure with example configuration files and ensure sensitive configurations are correctly handled (e.g., via `.gitignore`).

*Opened: 08 May 2025*
