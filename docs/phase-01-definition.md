# Phase 1: Discovery

## 1.1 Objectives & Success Criteria
**Objectives**

- Ingest historical and live race data (results, horses, jockeys, odds) from the Hong Kong Jockey Club into BigQuery.
- Define and publish a comprehensive, version‑controlled data dictionary covering all ingested datasets.
- Design and validate a conceptual and logical data model (ERDs) to support downstream analytics.
- Implement an automated ingestion pipeline (e.g., Airflow) with daily updates and alerting on failures.
- Deliver an exploratory data analysis notebook highlighting key metrics (e.g., average finish times, win rates).
- Establish CI/CD processes for code, tests, and documentation to ensure reproducibility.

**Success Criteria**

- ≥ 95% of historical races (2008–present) ingested with no critical data discrepancies.
- 100% field coverage in the data dictionary, tracked in version control.
- Pipeline reliability with < 1% daily failure rate; alerts triggered and resolved within 1 hour.
- Exploratory notebook includes at least 3 key performance indicators visualized and documented.
- Live documentation site available via GitHub Pages with ≥ 99% uptime.
